# Dev portal sample app for Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant type.

This sample shows how to use the openid-client library with Node.js to:
- Authenticate a registered user via IBM Security Verify
- Successfully make an API request to `userinfo` endpoint to return the authenticated users details.

## Running the sample app:
1. Create a `.env` file using the snippet generated by the Developer portal. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for the envrironment variables required to run this sample app.
2. From the CLI enter `npm install`
3. After successfully intalling node_modules, from the CLI start the sample application by running `npm run start`
4. When prompted enter a valid username and password that exists in your IBM Security Verify tenant.
5. If authentication is successful, you will see information about the authenticated user. This information is being retrieved by calling the OIDC UserInfo endpoint.

## Troubleshooting
- CLI displaying `npm ERR! code E401` when trying to run `npm install`. Delete the package-lock.json file and run `npm install` again.
